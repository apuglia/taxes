| State Tax Refund (NY) | $9,269 | 1099-G |

| Student Loan Interest | $29,039 paid | Max $2,500 deductible |
| Standard Deduction (Single) | $13,850 | |
| **Total Deductions** | ~$16,350 | |

## Tax Calculation (Estimated)
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|

| Less: Student Loan Interest | -$2,500 |
| **Taxable Income** | ~$89,979 |

| Federal Tax (Single, 2023 brackets) | ~$15,500 |
| Federal Tax Already Withheld | -$38,296 |
| **ESTIMATED FEDERAL REFUND** | **~$22,796** |

## Why Such a Big Refund?
1. Your W-2 had $38,296 withheld (based on $187K salary)
2. But the $90,483 K-1 LOSS reduced your taxable income dramatically
3. You were over-withheld because EY didn't know about the partnership loss

# IMPORTANT NOTES

## Panamerican Group LLC K-1
- You own 0.99% of this partnership
- The LLC already filed Form 1065 (otherwise no K-1 would exist)
- Your share of the 2023 loss: $90,483
- This is a PASSIVE loss - may have limitations (check with CPA)

## Your Other LLCs
If CannuMate, Vergincetrix, and Redi Servicios are single-member LLCs:
- They report on Schedule C of your personal return
- They didn't appear on your IRS transcript = no income reported
- You should still report them with $0 activity

## 2024 K-1?
No K-1 appeared on your 2024 transcript. Either:
- Panamerican Group had no activity in 2024
- The 2024 Form 1065 hasn't been filed yet
- Check with your business partner
