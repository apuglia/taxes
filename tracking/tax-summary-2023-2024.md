## Notes

### Gift Tax Consideration
Your dad gave you ~$210K in 2024. The annual gift tax exclusion is $18,000 per person (2024).
- Amounts over $18K require HIM to file a gift tax return (Form 709)
- You do NOT pay tax on gifts received
- This is HIS responsibility, not yours

### Why LLCs Show $0 Revenue
Based on transaction analysis:
- Money flowing INTO your LLCs came from YOUR personal accounts
- Money flowing OUT of LLCs went back to YOUR personal accounts
- No evidence of external client payments to LLCs
- This means LLCs had no actual business revenue
