# Questions to Ask Your CPA

## Purpose
These questions ensure your CPA does proper due diligence rather than just filing what you give them. A good CPA should have clear answers. Hesitation or vague responses = red flag.

---

## BEFORE Hiring (Screening Questions)

### Experience & Fit
1. "Have you handled back tax filings (2+ years late) before?"
2. "Do you have experience with partnership K-1s and passive loss rules?"
3. "Have you filed multi-state returns (NY + NJ) for clients?"
4. "What's your experience with Delaware LLCs?"

### Process
5. "Will you pull your own IRS transcripts or just use what I provide?"
6. "Will I see draft returns before you file, with time to ask questions?"
7. "If there's an audit, do you provide representation? Is it included or extra?"

### Liability
8. "Do you carry professional liability (E&O) insurance?"
9. "If you make an error that causes penalties, how is that handled?"

### Cost
10. "What's your fee for 2 years of federal + state returns with 4 Schedule Cs and a K-1?"
11. "Is that a flat fee or hourly? What would cause it to go higher?"

**Good answers:** Clear, specific, doesn't dodge. Should quote $500-1,500 for this scope.
**Red flag:** "Just send me everything and I'll figure it out" without asking clarifying questions.

## DURING Engagement (Due Diligence Questions)

### About the K-1 Partnership Loss (-$90,483 in 2023)

This is the most complex part of your return. The CPA MUST address this properly.

12. "The K-1 shows a $90,483 loss from a partnership where I own 0.99%. Is this a passive loss?"

13. "I didn't work day-to-day in that business - does that make it passive?"

14. "If it's passive, can I deduct it against my W-2 income, or is it suspended?"

15. "Are there any passive loss limitations I should know about? What's my passive loss carryforward if it can't be used?"

16. "Should I be looking at Form 8582 (Passive Activity Loss Limitations)?"

**Good answers:**
- Asks about your participation level (hours worked, decision-making role)
- Explains the difference between passive and non-passive
- Mentions Form 8582 if passive
- Tells you whether the loss is usable NOW or carried forward

**Red flag:** Just takes the loss at face value without asking about your involvement.

### About Multi-State (NY/NJ)

17. "I lived in NY but my employer (Ernst & Young) was technically in NJ. Do I need to file NJ?"

18. "Once I get my W-2, what boxes should I look at to determine state filing requirements?"

19. "If both states withheld taxes, will I get credit for taxes paid to the other state?"

20. "I worked remotely - does that affect which state I owe taxes to?"

**Good answers:**
- Asks where you physically worked
- Explains NY resident vs NJ non-resident treatment
- Mentions credit for taxes paid to other states
- Wants to see actual W-2 before deciding

**Red flag:** Assumes only NY without checking, or doesn't ask where you physically worked.

### About the LLCs

21. "I have 4 Delaware LLCs. Three are single-member, one is a partnership. How should each be reported?"

22. "Two LLCs (Vergincetrix, Redi Servicios) had zero activity. Do I still need Schedule C for them?"

23. "CannuMate had expenses but poor records. How should we handle that?"

24. "What's the deadline for Delaware franchise tax, and are there penalties for late payment?"

**Good answers:**
- Confirms single-member = Schedule C, partnership = K-1
- Yes, even $0 activity LLCs should be reported (or explains why not)
- Asks what expense documentation you have for CannuMate
- Knows Delaware franchise tax is due March 1 annually

**Red flag:** Doesn't ask about LLC ownership structure or just ignores them.

### About Prior Years & Carryovers

25. "I filed 2022 taxes. Are there any carryovers that should flow into 2023?"

26. "Could there be any suspended passive losses from before 2023?"

27. "Is there anything from my 2022 return I should provide to you?"

**Good answers:**
- Asks to see your 2022 return
- Checks for capital loss carryovers, passive loss carryovers, AMT credits
- Explains what would/wouldn't carry over

**Red flag:** Doesn't ask about prior year at all.

### About Potential Issues

28. "I received about $210,000 in wire transfers from my father in 2024. Do I need to report that?"

29. "I got an IRS refund of $20,436 in 2024 - is that taxable?"

30. "Are there any penalties for filing 2-3 years late? How do we minimize them?"

**Good answers:**
- Gifts received are not taxable income (your dad may need to file Form 709)
- Federal refunds are generally not taxable (state refunds might be if you itemized)
- Late filing penalty is 5%/month up to 25%, but no penalty if you're getting a refund
- Failure to file penalty doesn't apply if you're owed a refund

**Red flag:** Says wire transfers from family are income, or doesn't know late filing rules.

## AFTER They Prepare Returns (Review Questions)

Before you sign anything, review the draft returns and ask:

### Verification Questions

31. "Walk me through the main numbers - does my income on the return match my W-2?"

32. "Show me where the K-1 loss is reported. Is it being deducted or carried forward?"

33. "What's my total refund/amount owed for federal? For state?"

34. "Are all 4 LLCs reported somewhere on this return?"

### Sanity Checks

35. "My estimate was a federal refund around $20-25K for 2023. Your number is [X]. Why the difference?"

36. "Is there anything unusual about my return that might trigger an audit?"

37. "Are there any elections or decisions you made that I should understand?"

### Documentation

38. "What records should I keep in case of an audit?"

39. "Will you provide me with a copy of everything you filed?"

40. "How long do I need to retain these documents?"

**Good answers:**
- Walks you through Form 1040 line by line if you ask
- Can point to exact schedule/form for each item
- Explains any differences from your estimates
- Recommends keeping records 7 years

**Red flag:** Rushed, annoyed by questions, can't explain their own work.
