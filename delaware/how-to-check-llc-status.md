## If an LLC is Void

If any LLC shows "Void" status:

1. **Don't panic** - it can be reinstated
2. Pay all back franchise taxes + penalties
3. File a Certificate of Revival (~$200)
4. Wait for processing (usually 1-2 weeks)

**Important:** While void, the LLC doesn't provide liability protection. Get it reinstated ASAP if you're using it for business.
